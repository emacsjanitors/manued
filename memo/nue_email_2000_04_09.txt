ザーッと直しました. 完璧ではないですが, 山内さんのかなりスゴイ英語よりは
いいでしょう (もっと, 英語勉強しないといけませんよ).

{In t/T}hese days, I {must/have to} exchange many documents via Email.
And I {must/have to} proofread many documents. But, this is not easy
{way/work} for me. Paper and pens are {seemed/} very easy devices for
proofreading, since I can use special {/graphical} notation and
color. I always wonder{/ed} {that/} how {do/} {the/} people proofread
electr{ical/onic} documents.

I heard some people correct their documents using {/the} following
notation in Email.

	The Three Laws of Robotics by Azimuth.
				      ^^^^^^^
             This may be a mistake {with/for} Asimov. And the number of
             laws was changed from three to four, {isn't/wasn't} it?

However, the method using the symbol `^' is not easy for me. Reading
and typing take long time and I am easy to loose some fixed point in a
long document. I {also/} sometimes misunderst{and/ood} the
correct{ing/ion} point{/s} {with/in} proofreader's
comment{/s}. Especially, {however/though} {this is a/these are}
electr{ical/onic} document{/s}, I {cannot/could not} extract original
document{/s} nor {fixed/corrected} document{/s} {/easily}. The
information of {the/} correction {position/points} is very important
for {/understanding} proofreading{,/.} {s/S}o, when I receive{/d}
{the/a} newer document only, {there is some problems/I always got into
a trouble}. I {try/tried} to use `diff' command, but in that
situation, white space{/s} {is/are} harmful {/to extract necessary
information only.}  {and/Moreover,} we {can not/could not} include
{/vaulable} comments for corrected {part/points}. {Moreover/And
worse}, {each/everyone} {people/} always has a favorite mailer, and
different environment shows {the/a} different look{s/} for a mail,
since, for example, some environment{/s} use proportional font{/s} and
others {are/do} not.

Three years ago, a proofreading method {is/was} proposed by Ikuo
TAKEUCHI in {/the} Programming {s/S}ymposium{,/ in} Japan. {That/Its}
name is Manued (Tao of Manuscript Editing{ Language/}). In this
proofreading method, proofread{ed/} text {has/contains} {/some}
{/embedded} edit{/ing} command{/s}. For example, [A/B;C], {this/which}
means ``delete A and insert B{/;} {and C means comment/read C as a
helful comment}'' like sed command s/A/B/. This method is simple
{/enough} and {/does} not depend on {/any mailer}
environment. Moreover{/,} {this/a simple program} can {handle with a
program to/} extract fixed version or original version. {I will show
the rewrited example as follows./The following is the correction above
rewritten in Manued.}

	The Three Laws of Robotics by [Azimuth/Asimov; This may be a
	mistake {with/for} Asimov. And the number of laws was changed from
	three to four, {isn't/wasn't} it?]

This {shows change/indicates that} Azimuth {to/should be changed to}
Asimov and {I can exactly know the which is the comment part/shows a
comment related to the correction very clearly}. I implemented a
program `manued.el' that supports Manued proofreading{ method/}. {/The
program} {M/m}anued.el can search {/for} {the/} correct{ed/ion}
point{/s}, {hi-light/highlight} {the/} corrected region{/s}, extract
new{er/}/original document, and so on.

If you feel some {kind of/} trouble with fixing a manuscript via E-mail,
I think this method can help you.

You can download{ed/} the program `manued.el' from {/either} web site{s/:}

  http://www.archi.is.tohoku.ac.jp/~yamauchi/projects/manued/index.shtml
  http://ne.cs.uec.ac.jp/.

{However/Though}I implemented this method on Emacs, this method
{is/does} not depend on Emacs. {Then s/S}ome people {/may} want
{the/Manued} implementation {for/on} some other environments{,
like/such as} vi, MS Words{.../, etc.} However, I am not familiar with these
environments. If someone implement manued supporting program on {the/these}
environment{/s}, please inform me. Thanks.
